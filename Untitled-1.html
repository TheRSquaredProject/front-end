			Antara is a girl with a gigantic name and a tiny existence. Currently in her 2nd gap year, she still
			struggles with low self-esteem and being confused for a 6th grader. Besides procrastination and
			scrolling through memes, she spends most of her time sketching or writing reviews.
			Being the youngest in her family, she always felt unheard - which lead to writing more and talking less.
			She loves SpongeBob memes, anime, horror movies and tiny animals. Other than finally owning a
			bunny someday, Antara’s final goal is to bring a noticeable change in her country (maybe even in the
			world), which is one of the reasons for her joining the R- Squared Project. She believes that this project
			not only has the potential to bring changes in the system, but also keep her inspired to do so on her
			own someday.

			 An adventure-geared introvert with versatile interests, Fahim takes on life every day with an unquenching thirst for knowledge. In fact, his love for his bed is only defeated by his determination to discover how the world works through the perspectives of a variety of disciplines. His belief in the power of knowledge leads him to put it into use whenever he can for the greater good; his love of algorithms plays a vital role in his attempts at searching for efficient and quick solutions to problems. Pessimistic as he might seem to many of the people who know him, his work for the Project is driven by his belief that with a well-informed society, there is no barrier to solving the problems that we face in O(1) time.

			Being someone who doesn’t like crowded places ( or a bad headphone) , Nabil defines himself as an introvert. As most of his interests are tech-related, he often finds himself staring at a computer screen more and socializing less - something he wouldn’t change for the world. Nabil taught himself HTML and CSS in 9th grade and started making personal websites. Later, he moved towards harder things like Javascript, C++ and Python through something books and ‘trial and error’ which is basically short for - face a problem, google it, google it again and then fix the problem. He wishes to get good enough to work for tech giants like Google or Microsoft or some place where he can work with actually passionate and dedicated people to be a part of making something big.

			He started working for the R-Squared Project mainly because its potential and dedication to strive for greatness. Even though it may seem like his world revolves only around electronics and computers, Nabil has goals of his own. He wants to bring changes in the mindset of people and broaden their views, and he has a strong belief this project can help him achieve that.
