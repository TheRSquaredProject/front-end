								Being someone who doesnâ€™t like crowded places ( or a bad headphone) , Nabil defines himself as an introvert. As most of his interests are tech-related, he often finds himself staring at a computer screen more and socializing less - something he wouldnâ€™t change for the world. Nabil taught himself HTML and CSS in 9th grade and started making personal websites. Later, he moved towards harder things like Javascript, C++ and Python through something books and â€˜trial and errorâ€™ which is basically short for - face a problem, google it, google it again and then fix the problem. He wishes to get good enough to work for tech giants like Google or Microsoft or some place where he can work with actually passionate and dedicated people to be a part of making something big.

								He started working for the R-Squared Project mainly because its potential and dedication to strive for greatness. Even though it may seem like his world revolves only around electronics and computers, Nabil has goals of his own. He wants to bring changes in the mindset of people and broaden their views, and he has a strong belief this project can help him achieve that.

								struggles with low self-esteem and being confused for a 6th grader. Besides procrastination and

								<br><br>
								Being the youngest in her family, she always felt unheard - which lead to writing more and talking less.
								She loves SpongeBob memes, anime, horror movies and tiny animals. Other than finally owning a

In fact, his love for his bed is only defeated by his determination to discover how the world works through the perspectives of a variety of disciplines. His belief in the power of knowledge leads him to put it into use whenever he can for the greater good; his love of algorithms plays a vital role in his attempts at searching for efficient and quick solutions to problems. Pessimistic as he might seem to many of the people who know him, his work for the Project is driven by his belief that with a well-informed society, there is no barrier to solving the problems that we face in O(1) time.

									While Tanveer is an astrophysicist by profession, the applicability of data analysis skills he learnt from astronomy in social problems made him interested in R Squared. He is fascinated by how similar statistical modelling approaches can be utilized to solve both cosmological and more down to earth and pressing problems. He hopes to use his skills to address some of the challenges that Bangladesh faces via the R Squared platform.
