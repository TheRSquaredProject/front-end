				<h2>Why do men rape?</h2>
				<p>
					Research done by Naved RT et al found that 1 in 10 men had committed sexual assault of females including non-partners in
					Bangladesh. Further analysis of this research conducted by the R-স্কয়ার্ড team has been transformed into a brief infographic
					highlighting some of the factors behind rape.
					<br> Sections 2 and 3 highlight how important it is to analyze men’s attitudes towards women and women’s rights to understand
					why rape happens. Motivations for rape include sexual entitlement, anger and sadly, entertainment.
					<br> With this knowledge, it is important to ask ourselves:
					<br> Why do we tend to blame rape victims ? How does our attitudes contribute to this problem? How can we provide support
					to victims of such violence?
					<br> We still need to have far more difficult conversations regarding sexual violence to understand it more deeply and
					attack any aspect of our culture that condones such acts!

			<h2>How prevalent is rape, exactly?</h2>
			<p>
				As we approach the next decade, an important problem that Bangladesh faces is sexual violence (i.e: rape/ধর্ষণ). Although
				the path to a solution is difficult, the first step to solving the problem is to understand it more deeply, and a powerful
				way to understand is through data-visualization. In this pilot-project of The R-স্কয়ার্ড Project, I scraped data (Python:
				PyPDF2 ) on rape in Bangladesh over the past 10 years from online sources, and designed the infographic (R: ggplot2)
				below. Like any statistic, I encourage that the interpretation of these results should be your own; but I found the
				numbers to be both shocking and sadly, unsurprising:

				<li>
					1. According to the sources, the total cases of rapes reported per year (red line) has increased significantly (to about 800
					cases/year in 2017) over the last decade.
				</li>
				<li>
					2. Shockingly, the percentage of victims who were children/below 18 years of age (blue line) has been on the rise , reaching
					close to 70% in 2017!
				</li>
				<li>
					3. These two things are true even though the education sector of Bangladesh has performed well in enrolling more students into
					schools (the brown barchart in the background). So perhaps the thing to learn here is that simply increasing the
					quantity of education will not help, the CONTENT of education is also important. What we teach children at school
					(AND at home) is vitally important in how he/she affects society. Furthermore, for any prospective/new parents, the
					blue line tells us how important it is for children to be able speak to parents about issues of sexual harassment
					that they might be facing. Avoiding these issues as "taboos" in our households can only worsen the situation.

				</li>
				<li>
					4. If there is any good news, it's that the percentage of rape-victims who die/commit suicide as a result of rape has steadily
					been decreasing over the last 10 years (red/green piecharts in the bottom). It is perhaps fair to say that the amazing
					services for women (such as national helplines, NGOs fighting for victims, and online platforms that give women a
					voice, etc) are playing a role in bringing this number down.
				</li>
				<li>
					5. To keep it simple, I omitted certain important features from this picture, such as report-bias correction (i.e "are rape
					cases actually increasing or are they simply being reported more in media?"), and statistical checks for data-reliability
					(i.e "is the data even reliable?"). But anyone who is curious is encouraged to reach out and we can discuss about
					how I tackled these statistical problems, or even how you would tackle it.
