					<h2>WHY DO MEN RAPE?</h2>
					<p>
						Research done by Naved RT et al found that 1 in 10 men had committed sexual assault of females including non-partners in
						Bangladesh. Further analysis of this research conducted by the R-স্কয়ার্ড team has been transformed into a brief infographic
						highlighting some of the factors behind rape.
						<br> Sections 2 and 3 highlight how important it is to analyze men’s attitudes towards women and women’s rights to understand
						why rape happens. Motivations for rape include sexual entitlement, anger and sadly, entertainment.
						<br> With this knowledge, it is important to ask ourselves:
						<br> Why do we tend to blame rape victims ? How does our attitudes contribute to this problem? How can we provide support
						to victims of such violence?
						<br> We still need to have far more difficult conversations regarding sexual violence to understand it more deeply and
						attack any aspect of our culture that condones such acts!
