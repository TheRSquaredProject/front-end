					<h2>WHY DO MEN RAPE?</h2>
					<p>
					Research done by Naved RT et al found that 1 in 10 men had committed sexual assault of females including non-partners in Bangladesh. Further analysis of this research conducted by the R-স্কয়ার্ড team has been transformed into a brief infographic highlighting some of the factors behind rape.
					<br>
					Sections 2 and 3 highlight how important it is to analyze men’s attitudes towards women and women’s rights to understand why rape happens. Motivations for rape include sexual entitlement, anger and sadly, entertainment.
					<br>
					With this knowledge, it is important to ask ourselves:
					<br>
					Why do we tend to blame rape victims ? How does our attitudes contribute to this problem? How can we provide support to victims of such violence?
					<br>
					We still need to have far more difficult conversations regarding sexual violence to understand it more deeply and attack any aspect of our culture that condones such acts!
